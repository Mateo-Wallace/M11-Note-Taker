# M11 - Note Taker

## Description

Note Taker is a Web App saves notes and allows others to view said notes. It was made in order to practice Express. The application allows the user to create a note, save the note, and view previously saved notes by adding them to a database.

While building this project I learned to:
- Make a get, post, and delete request to an api
- Route those requests through various link extensions
- Serve dynamic html based on a back end database
